# Introduction

The purpose of this script is to analyze the ORGANOPHOSPHATE data set with FISH ONLY. The script will:

1. Extract the species located in the first quartile of the data; this information will be useful in terms of plotting.
2. Build single-chemical SSDs and extract the true HC5 values
3. Using the leave-one-out approach, build single-chemical SSDs and extract HC5s along with variance estimates.
4. Using all possible combinations of chemicals, create multiple SSDns with multiple nSpecies to get estimates of HC5 values
5. Summarize results generated and prepare plots
6. Plot relevant data

### Clear the existing workspace
```{r}
# Clear existing workspace
rm(list = ls())
```

### Load in required packages
```{r}
library(dplyr) # Used for data manipulation
library(tidyr) # data manipulation
library(RcppAlgos) # Used to create random draws of chemicals
library(data.table) # Used for creating data tables
library(EnvStats) # Used for calculating geometric means
library(plotrix) # used for calculating standard error
library(fitdistrplus) # for fitting various distributions to the data
library(flexsurv) # for fitting parametric distributions
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(ggpubr) # for exporting plots
```

### Load in the source data
Load in WEB-ICE data, prefiltered for only chemicals with data for 8+ species
```{r}
# Read in the WEB ICE data
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glted-mib/SSDn-Code/main/ICE_data_8_species.csv")
```

### Filter the data to only include organophosphate chemicals and fish species
```{r}
# Filter to only include organophosphate chemicals 
data <- data %>%
  filter(
    Specific_MOA == "Organophosphate"
  )

# Filter to only include fish species
data <- data %>%
  filter(
    Taxa == "Fish"
  )

# Check how many chemicals we have
unique(data$Chemical)
```

# Check the organophosphate data to see which chemicals have the most fish species and which do not
```{r}
# Filter and summarize the OP data to see which chemicals have the most species
species_summary <- data %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Chemical) %>% # group by chemical
  summarise(
    number_species = n_distinct(Species)) %>% # calculate number of species
  arrange(desc(number_species)) # arrange in descending order (most species at top)

# Looking at this data, there are 13 chemicals with at least 8 different fish species.

# select the chems that have 8 or more fish and make a vector to filter the main data by
chems_w_8_plus <- species_summary %>%
  filter(number_species >= 8) %>%
  dplyr::select(Chemical) 

# Make it a vector
chems_8_plus_vector <- chems_w_8_plus$Chemical


# Filter the main dataset to only include these chemicals
data <- data %>%
  filter(
    Chemical %in% chems_8_plus_vector
  )

# So, the "chems_8_plus_vector" represents the organophosphate chemicals that have data for 8 or more FISH species only.
```


### Extract relevant information for supplementary tables

```


# 1. Extract species data for first quartile

Extracting which species are in the first quartile (ie most sensitive species) for all chemicals is useful for making plots at the end.

### Find the species in the first quartile
The variable "all.chem.OP" represents the 13 organophosphate chemicals we will be using for this analysis.
```{r}
# Create a list of organophosphates
all.chem.OP <- c("Azinphos-methyl", "Chlorpyrifos", "Coumaphos", "Diazinon", "Dichlorvos", "Disulfoton", "EPN", "Fenitrothion", "Fenthion", "Malathion", "Methyl parathion", "Parathion", "Trichlorfon")

# Create an empty list for the most sensitive species
most.sensitive.species <- list()

# Create a loop to iterate through all the chemicals in the set
for(i in all.chem.OP) {

  #Calculating the average toxicity value (LC50) for each species 
  IndividualSSDs <- data %>% 
    filter(Chemical == i) %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarise(
      average = geoMean(Conc), # here I am using "average" instead of "geomean" as earlier
      minimum = min(Conc),
      sd = sd(Conc),
      n = n())
  
  IndividualSSDs <- unique(IndividualSSDs) #Adding toxicity data for each chemical to a list and making sure there are no duplicates
  
  # Create intermediate data frame
  Newdf <- IndividualSSDs
  
  #Calculating the probability points for each species and order them
  df <- Newdf[order(Newdf$average),]
  df$frac <- ppoints(df$average, 0.5)
  
  # Create intermediate data frame and filter by the lowest quartile
  most.sensitive.sp <- df %>%
  filter(
    average <= quantile(df$average, probs = 0.25))
  
  # Combine the data for this chemical into a data frame
  most.sensitive.sp.table <- data.frame(i, most.sensitive.sp)
  
  # Save this run of the loop as a place in the list
  most.sensitive.species[[i]] <- most.sensitive.sp.table
}

# Bind all of the elements of the list together into one data frame
most.sensitive.species <- rbindlist(most.sensitive.species)

# Rename the column names
colnames(most.sensitive.species) <- c("Chemical", "Species", "average", "minimum", "sd", "n", "frac")
```

# 2. Build single-chemical SSDs and extract HC5 values
We need to get the "true" HC5 values from the single chemical SSDs. The following code builds the single chemical SSDs and extracts the HC5 values from them.

### Extracting HC5 values for single chemicals
```{r}
# Create a list of chemicals from my data set
single.ssd.chems <- unique(data$Chemical)

# The individual.hc5s list will contain HC5 values from chemical-specific SSDs built using the best-fit method. These HC5s will be compared to the HC5s derived from SSDns.
individual.hc5s <- list()

#This loop calculates HC5 values from chemical-specific SSDs for each chemical in the all.chems list. It uses the best-fit method to fit the most appropriate distribution to individual chemical toxicity data (out of log-normal, log-logisitc, Weibull, and gamma distributions). The Anderson-Darling statistic is used to determine best-fit. The distribution with the lowest Anderson-Darling statistic is assigned as the "best.fit" method.
for(i in single.ssd.chems) {
  
  fit_gamma <- NULL
  best.fit <- NULL
  
  #Calculating the average toxicity value (LC50) for each species 
  IndividualSSDs <- data %>% filter(Chemical == i) %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarise(
      average = geoMean(Conc), # here I am using "average" instead of "geomean" as earlier
      minimum = min(Conc),
      sd = sd(Conc),
      n = n())
  
  IndividualSSDs <- unique(IndividualSSDs) #Adding toxicity data for each chemical to a list and making sure there are no duplicates
  
  # Create intermediate data frame
  Newdf <- IndividualSSDs
  
  #Calculating the probability points for each species 
  df <- Newdf[order(Newdf$average),]
  df$frac <- ppoints(df$average, 0.5)
  df
  
  #Fit a distribution to the plotted points
  fit_llogis <- fitdist(df$average, "llogis")
  fit_lnorm <- fitdist(df$average, "lnorm")
  fit_gamma <- try(fitdist(df$average, "gamma"), silent = TRUE) # use try here as gamma often fails
  fit_weibull <- fitdist(df$average, "weibull")
  
  # if there is an error with the gamma distribution, fit the other three instead
  if("try-error" %in% class(fit_gamma)){
    ll <- gofstat(fit_llogis)
    ln <- gofstat(fit_lnorm)
    w <- gofstat(fit_weibull)
    
    #Fit the best distribution to the data; identify it by the lowest anderson darling statistic
    a <- unlist(c(ll[8], ln[8], w[8]))
    best.fit.table <- data.table(c("llogis", "lnorm", "weibull"), a)
    m <- min(a)
    b <- best.fit.table$V1[best.fit.table$a == m]
  }  else {
    ll <- gofstat(fit_llogis)
    ln <- gofstat(fit_lnorm)
    g <- gofstat(fit_gamma)
    w <- gofstat(fit_weibull)
    
    #Fit the best distribution to the data; identify it by the lowest anderson darling statistic
    a <- unlist(c(ll[8], ln[8], g[8], w[8]))
    best.fit.table <- data.table(c("llogis", "lnorm", "gamma", "weibull"), a)
    m <- min(a)
    b <- best.fit.table$V1[best.fit.table$a == m]}
  
  #Calculate the best fit distribution
  best.fit <- fitdist(df$average, b)
  
  # Extract the estimated HC5 value
  hc5 <- quantile(best.fit, probs = 0.05)
  Estimated_HC5 <- hc5$quantiles$`p=0.05`
  
  # Bootstrap the HC5 value with upper and lower CIs
  fit_boot <- bootdist(best.fit, bootmethod = 'param', niter = 1000)
  
  # This step is not necessary I am just using it to check the bootstrap is working
  bootstrap_hc5 <- quantile(fit_boot, probs = 0.05)
  
  # Save the bootstrap and upper and lower confidence intervals
  Bootstrapped_HC5 <- bootstrap_hc5$quantiles$`p=0.05`
  HC5_lower_ci <- bootstrap_hc5$quantCI[1,1]
  HC5_upper_ci <- bootstrap_hc5$quantCI[2,1]
  
  # Save the HC5 values
  hc5.table <- data.frame(i, Estimated_HC5, Bootstrapped_HC5, HC5_lower_ci, HC5_upper_ci, b, m)
  
  individual.hc5s[[i]] <- hc5.table
}

#Binding the list of individual SSD hc5 values together 
individual.hc5s <- rbindlist(individual.hc5s)
colnames(individual.hc5s) <- c("Chemical", "SSD Estimated HC5", "SSD Bootstrapped HC5", "HC5 Lower CI", "HC5 Upper CI", "SSD Dist.", "SSD AD")

# Save the single-chemical HC5s as their own dataframe
single.individual.HC5s <- individual.hc5s
```


We have calculated the single-chemical HC5s, which are a good baseline and represent the "classic" SSD approach. Now, I will use the leave-one-out (LOO) approach to calculate the HC5s along with variance estimates.

# 3. Build and calculate LOO single-chemical SSDs and extract HC5 values.
The LOO approach we decided to use was to first make an SSD with the maximum possible number of species (N). Then, remove one species from the dataset so that the total number of species is (N-1). Using the dataset of (N-1) species, we make another SSD. We would continue to do that until all possible combinations of (N-1) species have been used to make an SSD.

In short, if there were N total species in the original chemical data, then the total number of single-chemical SSDs we could make using this method are N (N possible combinations of N-1 species)

### LOO Loop Generation
NOTE: The warning/error messages it may give are only because the code fits all four distributions (and most of the time, the gamma distribution gives an error). The code fits the best-fit distribution (which does not show an error code)

### Check LOO loop output and clean up data
Quickly check the work we did to see it works
```{r}
# First check for duplicates (the loop may have ran through an extra time)
individual.hc5s.LOO <- unique(individual.hc5s.LOO)

# Change column names to match the other HC5 output
colnames(individual.hc5s.LOO) <- c("Chemical", "Iteration", "SSD Estimated HC5", "SSD Bootstrapped HC5", "HC5 Lower CI", "HC5 Upper CI", "SSD Dist.", "SSD AD", "Species Left Out")
```

We have calculated the single-chem HC5s, the single-chem LOO HC5s, and now we can move on to the SSDn HC5s.

# 4. Build normalized SSDs and extract the HC5n/HC5 values
Using this method, we will create the maximum number of SSDns possible, by first creating the maximum number of combinations of chemicals and by using all possible nSpecies within each combination.

```


The "List.Statsdf.combo" is the raw output of all the SSDns we created using the loop. Before moving on to further analyses, it will be helpful to calculate relevant statistics and variables.

### Calculate means, SDs, SEs, and 95% CIs for the nSpecies and overall
There should be the HC5 for each species, and the overall chemical HC5 which is calculated by averaging all of the HC5s for the species for a single chemical. 

We are interested in the overall chemical mean rather than the nSpecies means as some species have a lot more data than others; if we only used each value to calculate the overall mean, we would weight the results to the species with more data - which we do not want to do.
```{r}
# First, calculate the means, standard deviations, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals around the nSpecies mean and overall chemical mean
Final.Data <- List.Statsdf.combo %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Chemical, nSpecies) %>% # first group by chemical then group by the nSpecies
  mutate(
    nspecies.mean.HC5 = mean(bf.HC5)) %>% # Calculate the mean HC5 for that nSpecies
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% # ungroup
  dplyr::group_by(Chemical) %>% # group by chemical
  mutate(
    chemical.mean.HC5 = mean(nspecies.mean.HC5), # calculate the overall average HC5 for that chemical (take the mean of a mean)
    chemical.sd.HC5 = sd(nspecies.mean.HC5), # calculate overall SD for each chemical
    no.obs.length = length(unique(nSpecies)), # calculate how many nSpecies were used for each chemical
    chemical.std.err.HC5 = (chemical.sd.HC5 / sqrt(no.obs.length)), # calculate standard error by dividing the SD by the square root of the sample size - in this case, how many nspecies there are 
    upper.CI = (chemical.mean.HC5 + 1.96*chemical.std.err.HC5), # calculate upper 95% CI
    lower.CI = (chemical.mean.HC5 - 1.96*chemical.std.err.HC5), # calculate lower 95% CI
    upper.SD.limit = (chemical.mean.HC5 + chemical.sd.HC5), # calculate mean + 1 SD
    lower.SD.limit = (chemical.mean.HC5 - chemical.sd.HC5)) %>% # mean - 1 SD
  dplyr::ungroup() # ungroup chemical so data is back how it was
```

### Add the single chemical HC5s to the final dataset
Add the single chemical HC5s (true HC5s) to the data - this is helpful for a few of the plots
```{r}
# Extract the chemical specific HC5s
single.hc5.table <- single.individual.HC5s %>%
  dplyr::select(Chemical, `SSD Estimated HC5`)
  
# Rename the columns so I can join to the full dataset
colnames(single.hc5.table) <- c("Chemical", "Single.C.HC5.bf")

# Join to full data set
Final.Data <- left_join(Final.Data, single.hc5.table, by = "Chemical")
```

We have added all relevant data and variables to our final dataset, which we can now use to make plots. 

# 5. Summarize and prepare plotting data

### Prepare LOO vs SSDn comparison data
The steps in this code chunk are pretty bulky, but what I am trying to do here with the wide vs long data is two things. First, by making the data into wide data I can export it cleanly as a table, which can go straight into the manuscript. The long data is needed specifically for plotting.
```{r}
### Generate the LOO plotting data
LOO.plotting.data.wide <- individual.hc5s.LOO %>%
  dplyr::select(Chemical, Iteration, `SSD Estimated HC5`) %>% # select only these columns
  dplyr::group_by(Chemical) %>% # group by chemical
  mutate(
    LOO.mean.HC5 = mean(`SSD Estimated HC5`), # calculate mean
    LOO.SD.HC5 = sd(`SSD Estimated HC5`), # calculate SD
    LOO.std.err = LOO.SD.HC5 / sqrt(length(Iteration)), # calculate standard error
    LOO.upper.CI = (LOO.mean.HC5 + 1.96*LOO.std.err), # calculate upper CI
    LOO.lower.CI = (LOO.mean.HC5 - 1.96*LOO.std.err), # calculate lower CI
    LOO.SD.upper = (LOO.mean.HC5 + LOO.SD.HC5), # calculate mean + SD
    LOO.SD.lower = (LOO.mean.HC5 - LOO.SD.HC5)) %>% # calculate mean - SD
  ungroup() # ungroup to revert data back to how it was

# Select only the mean/sd/se/ci columns
LOO.plotting.data.wide <- LOO.plotting.data.wide[ ,c(1,4:10)]
# Remove duplicates
LOO.plotting.data.wide <- unique(LOO.plotting.data.wide)

# Now we have a nice summary table of the HC5 data using the LOO method

### Clean the SSDn plotting data
SSDn.plotting.data.wide <- Final.Data %>%
  dplyr::select(
    Chemical, chemical.mean.HC5, chemical.sd.HC5, chemical.std.err.HC5, upper.CI, lower.CI, upper.SD.limit, lower.SD.limit) %>%
  unique()

# Same with the SSDn method

# Combine the two together so we can convert to long format
combined.plot.data <- left_join(LOO.plotting.data.wide, SSDn.plotting.data.wide)

# First extract just the means and convert to long format
long.data.means <- combined.plot.data %>%
  dplyr::select(Chemical, LOO.mean.HC5, chemical.mean.HC5) %>% # select only the chemical and two mean variables
  pivot_longer(cols = c("LOO.mean.HC5", "chemical.mean.HC5"), # pivot longer 
               names_to = "Method",
               values_to = "HC5.Mean.Estimate")
# Rename the method to LOO vs SSDn
long.data.means[long.data.means == "LOO.mean.HC5"] <- "LOO"
long.data.means[long.data.means == "chemical.mean.HC5"] <- "SSDn"

# Now do same for SDs
long.data.SDs <- combined.plot.data %>%
  dplyr::select(Chemical, LOO.SD.HC5, chemical.sd.HC5)%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("LOO.SD.HC5", "chemical.sd.HC5"),
               names_to = "Method",
               values_to = "HC5.SD.Estimate")
# Rename the method to LOO vs SSDn
long.data.SDs[long.data.SDs == "LOO.SD.HC5"] <- "LOO"
long.data.SDs[long.data.SDs == "chemical.sd.HC5"] <- "SSDn"

# Now do same for standard errors
long.data.SEs <- combined.plot.data %>%
  dplyr::select(Chemical, LOO.std.err, chemical.std.err.HC5)%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("LOO.std.err", "chemical.std.err.HC5"),
               names_to = "Method",
               values_to = "HC5.Std.Err.Estimate")
# Rename the method to LOO vs SSDn
long.data.SEs[long.data.SEs == "LOO.std.err"] <- "LOO"
long.data.SEs[long.data.SEs == "chemical.std.err.HC5"] <- "SSDn"

# Combine together
long.data.total <- left_join(long.data.means, long.data.SDs)
long.data.total <- left_join(long.data.total, long.data.SEs)

# add in upper and lower CIs
long.data.total <- long.data.total %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    HC5.Upper.CI = HC5.Mean.Estimate + 1.96*HC5.Std.Err.Estimate,
    HC5.Lower.CI = HC5.Mean.Estimate - 1.96*HC5.Std.Err.Estimate)
```



## Add in single chem SSD upper and lower CI to long data total
We want to compare the CIs for all three methods. For the conventional SSD method, we are using the upper and lower confidence interval of the best-fit distribution.
```{r}
###
single.individual.HC5s
single.ssd.long <- single.individual.HC5s %>%
  dplyr::select(Chemical, `SSD Estimated HC5`, `HC5 Lower CI`, `HC5 Upper CI`)

## add in relevant columns
single.ssd.long$Method <- "SSD"
single.ssd.long$HC5.SD.Estimate <- NA
single.ssd.long$HC5.Std.Err.Estimate <- NA

# re order the columns
single.ssd.long <- single.ssd.long[, c(1,5,2,6,7,4,3)] # leave the row index blank to keep all rows

# rename columns
colnames(single.ssd.long)[3] <- "HC5.Mean.Estimate"
colnames(single.ssd.long)[6] <- "HC5.Upper.CI"
colnames(single.ssd.long)[7] <- "HC5.Lower.CI"

long.data.total <- rbind(long.data.total, single.ssd.long)
```

# 6. Calculate some accuracy and uncertainty metrics

I am going to calculate fold-difference as the primary measure of accuracy (as in fold increase or decrease) and a ratio of the upper confidence interval to the estimate as a measure of uncertainty.

### Create a function for calculating the absolute value of fold-difference
```{r}
# Create the function. The fold difference gives the absolute value of the maximum of the two numbers being compared. If you want to look for directionality to determine if one value is lower than the other, then also compute the actual difference as chemA/chemB and just remember which one is your numerator and which is your denominator. I always calculate an “actual difference” every time I work with fold difference to ensure there isn’t a bias in over or under-estimation.
fold.diff <- function(prediction, actual) {
  return(max(prediction/actual, actual/prediction))
}

## test
fold.diff(10, 20)
fold.diff(20, 10)

# So what is happening here is we are simply getting the absolute value of the fold difference, which makes sense for our plots. IE going from 20 to 10 is a 2-fold decrease, and going from 10 to 20 is a 2-fold increase. Similarly, going from 5 to 10 is also a 2-fold increase, and 10 to 5 is a 2-fold decrease.
```


### Add in the single-chemical SSD HC5s to the long-data total dataset
```{r}
# Select the chemical and the single chemical HC5 columns and save as new dataframe
SSD.HC5s <- single.individual.HC5s %>%
  dplyr::select(Chemical, `SSD Estimated HC5`)

# Join them to the metric data frame
metric.data <- left_join(long.data.total, SSD.HC5s)

# Rename column names
colnames(metric.data)[8] <- "Single.SSD.HC5"
```




### Calculate an accuracy metric based on the fold-difference
```{r}
# the function does not work for data frames, so we have to apply it using a loop

### Set up a n empty list to hold the accuracy results along with the chemical identifier
accuracy.list <- list()
for (i in 1:nrow(metric.data)){
  Chemical <- metric.data$Chemical[i]
  Method <- metric.data$Method[i]
  Accuracy <- fold.diff(metric.data$HC5.Mean.Estimate[i], metric.data$Single.SSD.HC5[i])
  accuracy.list[[i]] <- data.table(Chemical, Method, Accuracy)
}

# Make it into a data frame
accuracy.list <- rbindlist(accuracy.list)

# Join into the accuracy test data frame
metric.data <- left_join(metric.data, accuracy.list)
```




### Uncertainty metric
The uncertainty metric we developed is the ratio of the SSDn upper CI to the SSDn HC5 average, given as A/B where A is the SSDn upper CI and B is the SSDn HC5 average.
In this metric, the closer you get to 1, the more certain you are. And the further away you get from 1, the more uncertain you are.
```{r}
### Create a test data frame with the metric
metric.data <- metric.data %>% # take from metric data
  dplyr::mutate(
    Uncertainty = HC5.Upper.CI/HC5.Mean.Estimate) # create the metric

# We have the metric, now we need to add in relevant factors that we think might be affecting uncertainty (so we can run a linear model/regression)

### Add in number of species in original single chemical SSD

# Filter and summarize the data to see which chemicals have the most species
no.spec.in.SSD.data <- data %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Chemical) %>% # group by chemical
  summarise(
    number_species = n_distinct(Species)) %>% # calculate number of species
  arrange(desc(number_species)) # arrange in descending order (most species at top)

### join to uncertainty test data
metric.data <- left_join(metric.data, no.spec.in.SSD.data)

### Rename column name
colnames(metric.data)[11] <- "Number.Species.in.SSD"


# Now add in the number of nSpecies (take this from the final data)
### add in number of nSpecies
no.n.spec <- Final.Data %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Chemical) %>%
  summarise(
    no.n.species = n_distinct(nSpecies)) %>% # calculate number of species
  arrange(desc(no.n.species)) # arrange in descending order (most species at top)

### Left join this into the uncertainty data
metric.data <- left_join(metric.data, no.n.spec)

### Rename column name
colnames(metric.data)[12] <- "Number.nSpecies.in.SSDn"
```


### Add in the range of min-max tox values from single-chemical SSD
```{r}
# Range in min-max tox values from single-chemical SSD
ssd.range <- data %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Chemical) %>%
  summarise(
    Chemical = Chemical,
    min.SSD.tox.val = min(Conc), # take min tox value
    max.SSD.tox.val = max(Conc), # take max tox value 
    min.max.SSD.range = max.SSD.tox.val - min.SSD.tox.val # take difference between them
  )

# Take only unique values
ssd.range <- unique(ssd.range)

# Join to metric data set
metric.data <- left_join(metric.data, ssd.range)
```



### Export the metric data as a CVS file so it can be used to create a table
```{r}
write.csv(metric.data, "OP_Fish_metric_data.csv")
```

#7. Create plots and figures

### Update the factor levels
I need to split this into two different plots.
```{r}
# Make the Method a factor

# Make test data frame
plot.1.data <- long.data.total
  
plot.1.data <- plot.1.data %>%
  filter(
    Chemical == "Azinphos-methyl" | Chemical == "Chlorpyrifos" | Chemical ==  "Malathion" | Chemical == "EPN" | Chemical ==  "Disulfoton" | Chemical ==  "Dichlorvos"
  )

# make method a factor with these levels to match the plot
plot.1.data$Method <- factor(plot.1.data$Method, levels = c("SSD", "LOO", "SSDn"))

# manually change the factor levels of the chemicals so that it goes in order from smallest HC5 to largest HC5
plot.1.data$Chemical <- factor(plot.1.data$Chemical, levels = c("Azinphos-methyl", "Chlorpyrifos", "Malathion","EPN", "Disulfoton", "Dichlorvos"))

```


### Comparison plot including the single-chemical HC5 as well
This plot has three values, the LOO HC5 mean and CI, the single-chemical HC5, and the SSDn HC5 mean and CI.
```{r}
# first make long data a factor so it can be plotted
plot.1.data$Method <- as.factor(plot.1.data$Method)


# set up color palette
comp.plot.colours <- c(SSD = "#000000", LOO = "#000000", SSDn = "#000000") # color palette (all black)
comp.plot.shapes <- c(SSD = 17, LOO = 19, SSDn = 15) # shape types


# Create a comparison plot
comp.plot.1 <- plot.1.data %>%

### Chemical 13: Trichlorfon

#### Plot 1: Raw SSDn Output plot
The chunk below filters the data only for Trichlorfon, then plots the raw output of all the SSDn results. The plot shows that overall, most nSpecies under-estimated the HC5 compared to the "true" HC5.
```{r}
# Filter the data to only include Trichlorfon
Trichlorfon <- Final.Data %>%
  filter(
    Chemical == "Trichlorfon"
  )

# Arrange the nSpecies by the toxicity value (so the most sensitive species are at the top)
Trichlorfon <- Trichlorfon %>%
   arrange(average, nSpecies)

# Extract the order of the species and check
Trichlorfon.n.spec <- unique(Trichlorfon$nSpecies)
Trichlorfon.n.spec

# Relevel the factors to match the order
Trichlorfon$nSpecies <- factor(Trichlorfon$nSpecies, levels = Trichlorfon.n.spec)
       
# Create the plot
Trichlorfon.plot <- ggplot(Trichlorfon, aes(x = nSpecies, y = bf.HC5))+ # X axis is the nSpecies, Y axis is the back-calculated HC5s that were generated from SSDs that used the nSpecies
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0.5))+ # add in the points
  geom_hline(yintercept = Trichlorfon$Single.C.HC5.bf, colour = "red")+ # Add the "true" HC5 as a red line across
  geom_hline(yintercept = (Trichlorfon$Single.C.HC5.bf*5), colour = "red", linetype = 2)+ # Add the 5-fold higher mark as a dashed red line
  geom_hline(yintercept = (Trichlorfon$Single.C.HC5.bf/5), colour = "red", linetype = 2)+ # Add the 5-fold lower mark as a dashed red line
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.5, linetype = 2)+ # Designate the first quartile to the left of the line
  theme_bw()+ # black and white theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+ # rotate x axis labels 45 degrees for reading
  scale_y_log10()+ # make whole graph log scale
  xlab("nSpecies")+
  ylab("HC5 (ug/L)")+
  ggtitle("Trichlorfon SSDn Estimated HC5s (FISH ONLY)") # add title

### Combine the results plots and then save
```{r}
# Combine the plots into one
combined.results <- ggarrange(comp.plot.1, comp.plot.2, nrow = 2, ncol = 1, common.legend = TRUE, legend = "right")

# Take a look
combined.results
```

# Save the results plot for the manuscript
```{r}
# save results plot for manuscript as a tiff file
tiff("OP_Fish_Results_FINAL.tiff", units = "in", width = 7.5, height = 10, res = 300) # load an empty tiff file with these dimensions
combined.results # put in the final results plot
dev.off() # close graphics so it saves
```


# Save and export the plots for use in manuscript

### Export SI plots for use in supplemental materials
```{r}
multi.page.plots <- ggarrange(Azinphos.methyl.plot, Chlorpyrifos.plot, Coumaphos.plot, Diazinon.plot, Dichlorvos.plot, Disulfoton.plot, EPN.plot, Fenitrothion.plot, Fenthion.plot, Malathion.plot, Methyl.parathion.plot, Parathion.plot, Trichlorfon.plot, nrow=1, ncol=1) # for one plot per page

multi.page.plots
ggexport(multi.page.plots, filename="OP_Fish_SI_Plots.pdf")
